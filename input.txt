Aeneas was a robust guy,
A kozak full of vim,
Full of the devil, lewd and spry,
There was no one like him.
And when the Greeks had burned down Troy
And made of it, to their great joy,
A heap of dung, he left that waste
Together with some Trojan tramps,
The sun-tanned scamps.
They all took to their heels in haste.

Constructing his boats at great speed,
He launched them on the bluish sea
And filled them with the men he'd need
As he sailed toward his destiny.
But Juno, daughter of a bitch,
A cackling hen with fighting itch,
Loathed him for being proud and deft.
She wished to see that his soul would
Fly to the deuce for good,
And no trace of him would be left.

To her he was like pepper, full of gall,
He always irritated her.
Her heart couldn't stomach him at all.
He was not her soliciting idolater.
She loathed him and it would annoy
Her so for he was born in Troy.
Besides, that Paris, his dad's brother,
Bestowed the apple as his recognition
Of triumph in a beauty competition
On Venus, his attractive mother,

When Heba saw the Trojans in the boats,
She whispered that news into Juno's ear -
The goddess looked, oh, holy goats!
And was filled up with overwhelming fear.
She yoked a peahen to a sledge,
Then pushed her hair beneath the headdress edge,
For to expose her braid would be a fault;
Dressed in a fitting corselet
And in a skirt, that old coquette,
Sped like a wasp to Aeolus, with bread and salt.
